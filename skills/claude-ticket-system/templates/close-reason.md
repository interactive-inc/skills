# Close Reason template

Present only when status is `cancelled`. Permanent once added.

Start with a plain text summary of why the ticket was closed. Add `##` headings as needed.

Common headings:

- `## Alternative` - What to do instead, if anything.

Additional `##` headings may be added freely.
