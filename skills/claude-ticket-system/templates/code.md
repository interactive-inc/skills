# Code template

Written during `code` phase. Documents what was implemented and how to verify.

Start with a plain text summary of what was done. Add `##` headings as needed.

禁止事項:

- `## Changes` は書かない。変更したファイル一覧や差分の要約など、`git diff` や `git log` で確認できる情報は一切記載しない。

Common headings:

- `## Deviations` - Differences from the plan, if any.
- `## Verification` - Checklist to confirm correctness.

Additional `##` headings may be added freely.
